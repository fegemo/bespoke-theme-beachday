## Usage

This theme is shipped in two ways:

1. in a [UMD format](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) and
1. as CSS files inside [dist/theme](dist/theme).

If you prefer to include it by requiring some JS file, you can use (1) as it makes the theme available as a CommonJS/AMD module or browser global.

For example, when using CommonJS modules:

```js
const bespoke = require('bespoke')
const beachday = require('bespoke-theme-beachday');

bespoke.from('#presentation', [
  beachday()
])
```

When using browser globals:

```js
bespoke.from('#presentation', [
  bespoke.themes.beachday()
])
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to include (2) CSS files directly, you can grab them from [dist/theme](dist/theme) directly. Reasons for this include if you strive for better performance, as loading the theme via (1) involves parsing a JS file before any CSS is included.

## Package managers
